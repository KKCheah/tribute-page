This Tribute Page project is based on the requirements of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project

Started this project on the 25th of May 2021. It was meant to be done using codepen.io but I figured using GitHub as a version control would be great to commit and push updates and will be of immense use in learning the best practices for my personal journey and development to be involved in the web development and/or the blockchain industry. Route to Ikigai

First and foremost, learn the best practices to writing a good README.md file. The contents of the README.md will be updated over time
